When replacing values, I made the option to choose whether to remove rows entirely or to replace the missing values with NA. I chose to include both options because there were many rows with missing values; however, the rows that had missing data often contained other useful information, meaning that we would lose a lot of information. By providing the option to replace missing values with NA, I was able to retain these rows for further analysis, while still indicating that certain fields were incomplete. Moreover, replacing the values with a mean value for example did not seem appropriate as there were fields that could not be filled with a mean such as a date. For outliers I chose the IQR method to identify outliers and removed them from the dataset if they were outside the upper and lower bounds.
